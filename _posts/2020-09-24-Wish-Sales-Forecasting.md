Wish.com, founded in 2010, is an e-commerce site that has gained popularity twenty-some years after the dot-com boom, to which sites like Ebay and Amazon owe their success.  So how did this late bloomer compete with the internet's used goods retail giants?  According to Sam Hollis, a blogger at jilt.com, "Wish has focused their business model on one thing and one thing only: price. Theyâ€™re not looking to expand into the media space, build tech gadgets, or even offer next-day delivery. Wish built their company to provide...products at the lowest possible price."

Of course, shoppers know that lower prices generally mean lower quality.  To gather public opinion on the quality of Wish.com's goods, one need look no further than the Google search bar suggestions for Wish vs. Amazon:

By looking at what is commonly searched for after "Wish is", it's clear that Americans are hesitant to trust the site, perhaps because of the deep discounts, or perhaps because it's newer to the scene.

To see what actually drives sales on Wish, I used a dataset of product information scraped from the website in August, 2020.  Below is an example of the information used to predict sales volume of each product.

Outside of these data, I also had product rating, merchant rating, and how many total ratings they had received.  I ended up removing the latter, as it was leaking information into the label.  In other words, when a product sells a high volume, it will organically recieve more feedback than a product that sells at low volume.  So the predictor depended on the prediction, not the other way around.

You might have noticed that the search results page doesn't list exact quantities sold, only figures like "10+", "50+", "100+", and so on.  This means that the model will output a category (low sales, medium sales, or high sales) instead of a number.

But first let's make sure the data makes sense.  It would make sense that merchants with high ratings will sell products that tend to also have high ratings.  Looking at a 3D partial dependence plot of the two shows that there is indeed a peak toward the area where merchant rating and product rating are high.

40% of the sales quantities were 'high', so if we predicted 'high sales' for every single product, we'd have 40% accuracy.  In other words, a model that scores above 40% is the goal.  This particular random forest classifier reached an accuracy of 55% after removing leakage.  (With leakage, the model was near 90% accuracy.)  The model performed relatively well in predicting when sales would be high or low.  It's predictions for medium, however, were low in accuracy.  A confusion matrix of the prediction accuracies on a validation set is below:

After tuning parameters, I chose to stick with this model, erring on the side of an incorrect prediction of 'medium' rather than an incorrect prediction of 'high' or 'low'.  This is because a seller will suffer more if sales are predicted as high, but end up being low, and vice versa.  Incorrectly predicting 'medium sales' will only ever be off by on category, never by two.

After buildling the model and tuning its hyperparameters, perhaps the most informative information is not its predictive power, but rather a mathematical explanation of which features affected prices the most.  In technical terms, I permuted each feature's values, then measure the mean average error (MAE) after the permutation and subtracted it from the MAE before the permutation.  Below are the differences in MAE pre- and post- permutation.

With Wish's reputation for cheap prices and user skepticism regarding website legitimacy, it's no surprise at all that merchant rating and product rating are significantly more predictive of sales volume - even more than price!  This tells us that users are paying close attention to consumer feedback, and that it impacts their decision above any other factor.  Product price was next in importance, but shipping price was toward the bottom.  Both of them are paid with the same money - so why don't users care about shipping price?  Well, shipping price isn't on the main search page.  It's only after you have selected the item that shipping price information appears.  So, it's probably not that users don't consider shipping price, and probably more because they can't be drawn to a product feature that they can't see when comparing products.

Perhaps the most interesting predictor of sales is the presence or absence of a profile picture.  There are two ways to take this.  Either of these explanations is logical, and it's possible that both are true.:
1) Consumer psychology.  Actually seeing a picture of the merchant's face boosts confidence in seller legitimacy, in turn boosting sales.
2) Data leakage.  One-off sellers (low sales volume) may be less likely to upload a profile picture than those that have sold multiple items.

Something else that Wish merchants might want to know is that Ad Boosters have very little affect on sales volume.  If those ad boosters cost much to run, the data shows that it's not worth their money.  Another thing that consumers don't care about is where the product is shipping from, and this is probably because most sellers are in Asia.  The mindset is this:  "It's going to take forever regardless - who cares if it comes from China or Indonesia?"

Color and size are somewhat predicitve, but this graph alone doesn't tell a merchant which colors or sizes are selling the most.  In order to find this out, I used a linear regression after normalizing each feature's values.  This way I could compare coefficients apples-to-apples.  These are a few of the more notable weights:
Increase sales:  Colors black, white, gray, and purple, and sizes medium through XL.
Decrease sales:  Colors pink, yellow, and green, and sizes XS and 2XL+

The above colors and sizes make sense.  Black, white, and gray match everything, whereas pink, yellow, and green are for fewer consumers.  Most of the population lies within Medium-XL, fewer people fall in the more extreme sizes like XS or 2XL+.

A few key takeaways for new Wish sellers who want to make it big are this:
1) Quality over price.  Consumer ratings are king!
2) Make sure you're always stocked on neutral colors and normal sizes.
3) Take the 30 seconds to upload a profile pic.  It could be a major factor.
4) Don't invest in ad boosters; they're probably not worth it.
5) Don't have badges?  Don't sweat it.  They don't help, anyway.
