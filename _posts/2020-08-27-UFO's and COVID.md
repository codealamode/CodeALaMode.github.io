Psychologists have long theorized on the causes of large-scale conspiracy theories and paranoid thinking.  Some have hypothesized that a person will invent situations when they are lacking crucial information about their environment.  Other psychologists believe that negative self-image manifests in distrust of the group as a whole, leading many to conspiratorial beliefs.  However, a 2015 study in the Netherlands finds that anxiety may be the causative factor:

"In a 2015 study in the Netherlands, researchers split college students into three groups. People in one group were primed to feel powerless. The scientists asked them to recall and write about a time in their lives when they felt they were not in control of the situation they were in. Those in a second group were cued in the opposite direction. They were asked to write about a time when they felt totally in control. And still others, in a third group, were asked something neutral: to describe what they had for dinner last night. Then the researchers asked all the groups how they felt about the construction of a new subway line in Amsterdam that had been plagued by problems.

Students who had been primed to feel in control were less likely than students in the other two groups to support conspiracy theories regarding the subway line, such as the belief that the city council was stealing from the subway’s budget and that it was intentionally jeopardizing residents’ safety."  - Melinda Wenner Moyer on March 1, 2019, www.scientificamerican.com
 
About a year after the above was published, on March 13th, 2020, the White House declared COVID-19 a National Emergency.  Later that week, the CDC declared it a global pandemic, and Americans' anxiety levels went through the roof.  Feelings of powerlessness swept across the country as millions lost their jobs and plummeted into financial insecurity, all while worrying about their health in the face of a highly infectious outbreak.

If the Dutch researchers were right, this would be the prime time for UFO sightings to go through the roof!  So I visited the National Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting Center's website and examined UFO sighting trends for various time periods.

I decided to use the time period from April 7th-26th for a few reasons.  Of the 50 states, 44 of them had governor's orders to close down non-essential places of business.  The latest start date of these was April 7th, and the earliest re-open date was April 26th.  So, from April 7th-26th, residents of 44 states were stuck at home, plugged into news that was reporting the latest death tolls, and speculating how long a vaccine will take.

For a control, I compared reported UFO sightings per capita in from April 7th-26th, 2020 with that exact same time period for the past four years.  Below is a bar graph comparing them.
