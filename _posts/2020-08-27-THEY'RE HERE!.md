Psychologists have long theorized on the causes of large-scale conspiracy theories and paranoid thinking.  Some have hypothesized that a person will invent situations when they are lacking crucial information about their environment.  Other psychologists believe that negative self-image manifests in distrust of the group as a whole, leading many to conspiratorial beliefs.  However, a 2015 study in the Netherlands finds that anxiety may be the causative factor:

"In a 2015 study in the Netherlands, researchers split college students into three groups. People in one group were primed to feel powerless. The scientists asked them to recall and write about a time in their lives when they felt they were not in control of the situation they were in. Those in a second group were cued in the opposite direction. They were asked to write about a time when they felt totally in control. And still others, in a third group, were asked something neutral: to describe what they had for dinner last night. Then the researchers asked all the groups how they felt about the construction of a new subway line in Amsterdam that had been plagued by problems.

Students who had been primed to feel in control were less likely than students in the other two groups to support conspiracy theories regarding the subway line, such as the belief that the city council was stealing from the subway’s budget and that it was intentionally jeopardizing residents’ safety."  - Melinda Wenner Moyer on March 1, 2019, www.scientificamerican.com
 
About a year after the above was published, on March 13th, 2020, the White House declared COVID-19 a National Emergency.  Later that week, the CDC declared it a global pandemic, and Americans' anxiety levels went through the roof.  Feelings of powerlessness swept across the country as millions lost their jobs and plummeted into financial insecurity, all while worrying about their health in the face of a highly infectious outbreak.

If the Dutch researchers were right, this would be the prime time for UFO sightings to go through the roof!  So I visited the National Unidentified Flying Objects Reporting Center's website and examined UFO sighting trends for various time periods.

I decided to use the time period from April 7th-26th for a few reasons.  Of the 50 states, 44 of them had governor's orders to close down non-essential places of business.  The latest start date of these was April 7th, and the earliest re-open date was April 26th.  So, from April 7th-26th, residents of 44 states were stuck at home, plugged into news that was reporting the latest death tolls, and speculating how long a vaccine will take.

For a control, I compared reported UFO sightings per capita in from April 7th-26th, 2020 with that exact same time period for the past four years.  Below is a bar graph comparing them.

An eyeball assessment will probably tell you that reported UFO sightings increased significantly over the lockdown period.  But for you statisticians out there, a two-sample t-test on the mean per-capita observations in 2020 and the mean per-capita observations in the preceding four years yielded p-values all below 0.001.

We can also see from the graph that there seems to be a big disparity in the number of reported sightings amongst regions in the USA across all five years measured.  This begs the question - are any states reporting significantly higher numbers of UFOs than other states?

After standardizing all observations from the years 2016-2019 for each state in the data set, we find that Idaho and New Hampshire yield z-scores of 3.26 and 2.65 respectively.

If you look closely, you'll see that the top four states are all in very different regions of the US.  So how is it that over COVID lockdowns, the mountain regions suddenly became the hotbed of extraterrestrial visitations?  Below, you'll see that Oregon and Washington, despite not even making it into the top ten over the past four years, reported six to nine times the national average of the previous year.

Whether it's due to high anxiety and clear Oregon skies or due to Martian neighbors popping in to say "Get well soon, Earthlings!" in a time of global crisis, we can be certain that lockdown period UFO sightings were out of this world.
