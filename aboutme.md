I'm Reid, and this is a site I created to share the work I've done in data science.

The posts I share are usually projects where I've applied data analytics and machine learning to answer some (hopefully interesting) questions.

Source code can be found on my github, where I have the shnazzy username CodeALaMode.  =)

Enjoy!
